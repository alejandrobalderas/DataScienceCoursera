My First R Markdown File
=============================

This is my first R Markdown file

Here we are going to load data

```{r}
library(datasets)
data("airquality")
summary(airquality)
```

Lets first make a plot

```{r}
pairs(airquality)
```

Here is a regression model of ozone on wind, solar radiation, and temperature.

```{r}
library(stats)
fit <- lm(Ozone ~ Wind + Solar.R + Temp, data = airquality)
summary(fit)
```
